- Method sets - Methods attach to a TYPE
- What is th eset of methods for a given type? - Method set
- Method set of a type determines the INTERFACES that the type implements
- NON-POINTER RECEIVER & NON-POINTER VALUE - (t T) ~ T
- NON-POINTER RECEIVER & POINTER VALUE - (t T) ~ \*T
- POINTER RECEIVER & POINTER VALUE - (t *T) ~ *T
- POINTER RECEIVER & NON-POINTER VALUE - - (t \*T) ~ T - Does not work
